The system starts with this flag set, and it is recommended that your application always use this flag. The substitution occurs only if the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Keyboard\Layout\Substitutes explicitly defines a substitution locale. For example, if the key includes the value name "00000409" with value "00010409", loading the U.S. English layout ("00000409") causes the Dvorak U.S. English layout ("00010409") to be loaded instead. The system uses KLF_SUBSTITUTE_OK when booting, and it is recommended that all applications use this value when loading input locale identifiers to ensure that the user's preference is selected.
